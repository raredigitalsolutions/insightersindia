    snippet: 'Man is made up of physical body, thoughts and emotions. Emotions are at a deeper level than thoughts. Man does not live so much according to his thoughts, but lives more according to his emotions. So, for transformation in life to take place, it is not enough if thoughts alone change; emotions should also change. At its core, Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand and manage one’s own emotions in order to communicate effectively, overcome challenges, relieve stress, resolve conflicts, and foster group harmony and teamwork…...',

      'EI is measured through Emotional Quotient (EQ). When it comes to success and happiness in life EQ matters more than Intelligence Quotient (IQ). It is a common observation that the smartest and most intelligent people are not the most successful in life.',
      ' There is no doubt that IQ has its role in taking a person to higher positions in life, But, it is the EQ that will help one to navigate the social complexities of the work place and excel in one’s career. If a person fails to manage his emotions well, he will not be managing his stress either and the result will be leading an unhappy, miserable life with a poor immune system, resulting in poor physical and mental wellbeing.',
      'The training session on Emotional Intelligence will impart in the participants, four key skills, viz., self-management, self-awareness, social awareness and relationship management. This will transform a person to lead a meaningful, stress-free life achieving career and personal goals with ease. An emotionally intelligent person will radiate positive energy and will be highly sought-after by the people around. Such a person will, for sure, be an asset for any organization.',

The ‘why’ of the Law of gravity is complicated to understand, even for the best scientific mind. The Law of Gravity works; The Law of Attraction (LOA) also works. LOA is not a complicated magic. It is a simple and unchanging universal principle. LOA is a philosophy which suggests that positive thoughts bring positive results into a person’s life while negative thoughts bring negative outcomes.',

      '‘Like attracts like’ - the fact behind the Law of Attraction is very simple. The disappointing thing is the wrong understanding of the law and the false expectations of how the law works. This has made many people discount the law as something that does not really work.',
      'Learning how to use the law consciously to enhance your life is an intricate skill. It takes time to master the skill. But, it is not difficult. Since this is a universal law, it works. The fundamental law that governs the universe is the Law of Vibrations, according to which everything in the universe starting from the planets floating in the space to the tiny grains of sand on the earth are all in a state of vibration. This is the hard reality. From this reality emerges the fact that ‘Like attracts like’ which is the rule governing the Law of Attraction.',
      'Hence, understanding how the law works makes all the difference. Once a person gets a grasp of this, the law will definitely work for him. Life is simply magical, not logical. Because, the subtle ways through which life exists defies all logics.',
      'The training session on the Law of Attraction will expose the participants to the magical ways through which life sustains on the earth. For a person who understands this, the Law of Attraction will simply work. For others, it will only be a distant mirage.'

If we want to prioritize the assets owned by an organization in terms of their importance, many things may come to our mind – Research & Development, Marketing, Intellectual Property Rights, Sophisticated technology owned by the organization and the like. But, the fact remains hidden. Though, these are no doubt valuable assets for an organization, the one that stands out and most valuable is the ‘Human Resource’ of the organization. This is the supporting force that lies behind all other forms of assets. Hence, the success of an organization will be guaranteed if its human resources remain committed and motivated.',

      'People matter most for any organization. It is the human resource that differentiates an organization from its competitors. The success or failure of an organization is in the hands of the employees. An organization will succeed if its employees give their 100%. Employees are the face of an organization and they are the first customer. But, the human resource will act as an invaluable asset only if the employees remain motivated and contribute their maximum towards achievement of the organizational objectives. Employees, as human beings will have their own priorities in life. Every employee is different in many aspects. Orienting their mind-set towards the organization is a very big challenge. Here lies the relevance of Motivational training programmes. The programme should first transform the employees in such a way that they understand the importance of their contribution to the organization. The Motivational training programme does this difficult but possible job of transforming the employees. A transformed employee will remain committed and motivated and will perform to his /her capacity. Such an employee will become an indispensable asset. ‘Insighters India’, with its motto of ‘Transform and Perform’ is capable of transforming every employee, making them remain motivated and contribute their best.

But, physical comfort at the cost of mental wellbeing is not desired. Handling stress correctly is possible only when its root cause is identified.',

      'Stress Management is more of a mind stuff. To know as to how stress arises in a person, on should dig deep down to identify its roots. Stress is all due to underlying fear. The fear may be due to anything that affects a person, maybe fear of losing job, fear of not being able to meet the targets, fear of intimidating boss, fear of inability to make a comfortable living, fear of interpersonal conflicts and their consequences etc., On the personal front, fear may be due to threatening family problems like divorce, ill-health of dependent family members etc., If we dissect any possible cause for stress, underneath it we will find the fear of death, which lies as the fundamental cause for all other forms of fear. Fear of death is fear of time and fear of time is deeply the fear of unlived moments, unlived life.  The solution to be free from fear (and hence free from stress) is simple. The solution lies in living life more intensely, more meaningfully.',
